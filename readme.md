# A quick note on leaflet

## Intro

Leaflet is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for interactive maps. Itâ€™s used by websites ranging from The New York Times and The Washington Post to GitHub and Flickr, as well as GIS specialists like OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and CartoDB.

The R package `leaflet` made by rstudio (thanks to the team) makes it easy to integrate and control leaflet and map

It becomes very popular since a year, when we have to deal with javascript to integrate stuff like : cluster, dynamic legends, combination with json.

The step by step tutorial here : [https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)

## A quick code

Whit the few following lines of code, we can plot a dynamic map.

Here, It is about spain and some spots where people meet


```r
# Read and organize data
load("./../garage_score.RData")
load("./../xptIOP.RData")

sp_data= dplyr::select(data,entity,garage_lon,garage_lat,global_scoring,claims_volume_2011_2014,
                   NAME_2)
```

Packages and data cleaning


```r
# Package to use
library(rgdal)
```

```
## Loading required package: sp

```

```r

```

```

## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

```

```r

```

```r

```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'rMaps'
## 
## The following objects are masked from 'package:rCharts':
## 
##     Datamaps, Leaflet, makeChoroData, processChoroData, rqMap
```

```r
library(leaflet)

sp_data = filter(sp_data,garage_lon>=-10)
names(sp_data)<- c("entity","long","lat","score","nb_claims","city")

# Contours of spain
filename<-list.files(".", pattern=".shp", full.names=FALSE)
filename<-gsub(".shp", "", filename)
dat<-readOGR(".", filename) 
```

```
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: ".", layer: "ESP_adm2"
## with 51 features
## It has 11 fields
```

```r
# ----- Transform to EPSG 4326 - WGS84 (required)
subdat<-spTransform(dat, CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))
# ----- change name of field we will map
names(subdat)
```

```
##  [1] "ID_0"      "ISO"       "NAME_0"    "ID_1"      "NAME_1"   
##  [6] "ID_2"      "NAME_2"    "NL_NAME_2" "VARNAME_2" "TYPE_2"   
## [11] "ENGTYPE_2"
```

```r
names(subdat)[names(subdat) == "NAME_1"]<-"city"
#leafdat<-paste(getwd(), "/",  ".geojson", sep="") 
#writeOGR(subdat, leafdat, layer="", driver="GeoJSON")
sp_json <- readLines("./ESP_adm2.geojson", warn = FALSE) %>% paste(collapse = "\n") 
```

Mapping


```r
# mapping
sp_data$cut <- with(sp_data, cut(nb_claims, 
                                breaks=quantile(nb_claims,
                                                probs=seq(0,1, by=0.1)), 
                                include.lowest=TRUE))

my_colors  <- colorFactor(
  palette = "Blues",
  domain = sp_data$cut
)


m= leaflet(sp_data) %>%
  addTiles()%>%
  addCircleMarkers(radius = ~log(nb_claims), lng= ~long,
                   lat=~lat, opacity = 0.3, weight=1,
                   color = ~my_colors(cut)) %>%
  addMarkers(
    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()) %>% 
  addGeoJSON(sp_json,weight = 1,fill = FALSE,opacity = 0.5,color = "#444444")%>%
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = my_colors, values = ~cut,
            title = "Nb of what I want",
            opacity = 1
  )

m
```
It looks like 

![my leaflet][id]





Done !
